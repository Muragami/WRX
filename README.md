# WRX
W|ren R|eady eX|excution engine: _Wren-powered apps everywhere_.

 * **Wren**: It's the language â€” a classy, little scripting language with good, portable performance.
 * **Ready**: The style is a reduced, ready-to-use, minimal interface to build your app upon.
 * **eXecution engine**: As this is abstract, one of many engines that can host the app. Pixi.js for the web, and Love2D for desktop to start.
